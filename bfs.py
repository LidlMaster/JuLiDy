# Follow the below method to implement BFS traversal.

# Declare a queue and insert the starting vertex.
# Initialize a visited array and mark the starting vertex as visited.
# Follow the below process till the queue becomes empty:
# Remove the first vertex of the queue.
# Mark that vertex as visited.
# Insert all the unvisited neighbors of the vertex into the queue.

# BFS pseudocode:
# create a queue Q 
# mark v as visited and put v into Q 
# while Q is non-empty 
#     remove the head u of Q 
#     mark and enqueue all (unvisited) neighbours of u
